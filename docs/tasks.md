# IIIF Image API Example - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the IIIF Image API Example project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

### Component Structure
[ ] Refactor the large IiifImage.vue component into smaller, more focused components:
  [ ] Create a separate ImageControls component for the settings panel
  [ ] Create a separate ImagePreview component for the preview area
  [ ] Create a separate ImageInformation component for displaying image metadata

  [ ] Create a separate NavigationLinks component for the example links

### State Management
[ ] Improve the iiifImageStore implementation:
  [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for IIIF image information
  [ ] Remove commented-out code and TODOs
  [ ] Split the store into smaller, more focused stores if necessary
  [ ] Add better error handling for API requests

### Routing
[ ] Enhance the router implementation:
  [ ] Add a default route for when no URL is provided
  [ ] Implement proper error handling for invalid URLs in the route
  [ ] Consider adding additional routes for different views or features

## Code Quality Improvements

### TypeScript
[ ] Improve TypeScript usage throughout the codebase:
  [ ] Add proper type definitions for all functions and variables
  [ ] Replace any types with more specific types
  [ ] Add type guards where necessary
  [ ] Ensure consistent use of TypeScript features

### Performance
[ ] Optimize performance:
  [ ] Review and optimize debounce implementation
  [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
  [ ] Add caching for previously loaded images
  [ ] Optimize CSS for better rendering performance

### Error Handling
[ ] Enhance error handling:

  [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
  [ ] Add logging for errors to help with debugging
  [ ] Handle edge cases like network failures

### Accessibility
[ ] Improve accessibility:
  [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
  [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation
  [ ] Add screen reader support
  [ ] Implement proper focus management
  [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast

## Testing Improvements

### Unit Tests
[ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests:
  [ ] Add tests for the iiifImageStore
  [ ] Add tests for utility functions like debounce
  [ ] Add tests for all components
  [ ] Ensure good test coverage for critical functionality

### End-to-End Tests
[ ] Update and expand end-to-end tests:
  [ ] Fix the existing e2e test to match the current application structure
  [ ] Add tests for core user flows
  [ ] Add tests for error scenarios
  [ ] Add tests for different screen sizes

## Documentation Improvements

### Code Documentation
[ ] Improve code documentation:
  [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all functions and components
